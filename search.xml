The system has four modules with an region overview functiona-lity, which contains base datasets selection, process parameter configuration, spatialtemp-oral analysis and scenario simulation. Precipitation and social-economic water are two vital factors that affect the ecosystem carrying capacity. Region overview shows us the ev-aluation results of history and future ecosystem carrying capacity directly, and according to different geomorphological types, we can find out whether different regions are overloa-ded or not.</p><div align="center">    <img src="/2021/01/21/huang-tu-gao-yuan-sheng-tai-xi-tong-cheng-zai-li-xi-tong-she-ji/figure1.jpg" width="600" alt="figure1"></div><p>  ECCAS is coded in Python, Matlab, Scala and JavaScript based on the Linux operating system. All models and data are encapsulated in the bottom framework. For interacting with geospatial files, ECCAS uses the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL, 2015) for raster and vector handling. The related models are accessed by ECCAS via the python API. Base data selection can be accessed from a series of drop down menus, from live ‘radio-buttons’, or from toolbars embedded in the user interface, which means that users can circumvent use of the drop down menu system. Selecting the suite of radio buttons and toolbars is performed by clicking the respective active area of the screen with the mouse. In summary, ECCAS is designed to achieve communication, persistence and accessibility merits in terms of platform independence, as well as model sharing, high performance computing and dynamic visualization capabilities.</p><div align="center">    <img src="/2021/01/21/huang-tu-gao-yuan-sheng-tai-xi-tong-cheng-zai-li-xi-tong-she-ji/figure2.jpg" width="600" alt="figure2"></div><h2 id="FUNCTION"><a href="#FUNCTION" class="headerlink" title="FUNCTION"></a>FUNCTION</h2><h3 id="HOMEPAGE"><a href="#HOMEPAGE" class="headerlink" title="HOMEPAGE"></a>HOMEPAGE</h3><p><strong>  This module is the integration of social and economic water consumption, precipitation, NDVI, GPP, the carrying capacity of ecological system related information or preliminary results.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Precipitation</strong></p><ul><li>Brief introduction of precipitation.</li><li><code>Sequence</code> : Time sequence of rainfall between start year and end year, including six geomorphic regions of the Loess Plateau and LP.</li><li><code>Pattern</code> : The precipitation spatial pattern of this period.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>SEWD</strong></p><ul><li>Brief introduction of Social Economic Water.</li><li><code>Sequence</code> : Time sequence of rainfall between start year and end year, including six geomorphic regions of the Loess Plateau and LP.</li><li><code>Pattern</code> : The spatial pattern of this period.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>NDVI</strong></p><ul><li>Brief introduction of NDVI.</li><li><code>Sequence</code> : Time sequence of rainfall between start year and end year, including six geomorphic regions of the Loess Plateau and LP.</li><li><code>Pattern</code> : The spatial pattern of this period.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>GPP</strong></p><ul><li>Brief introduction of GPP.</li><li><code>Sequence</code> : Time sequence of rainfall between start year and end year, including six geomorphic regions of the Loess Plateau and LP.</li><li><code>Pattern</code> : The spatial pattern of this period.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>ECC</strong></p><ul><li><strong>ECC</strong><ul><li>Brief introduction of Ecosystem Carrying Capacity.</li><li><code>Sequence</code> : Time sequence of rainfall between start year and end year, including six geomorphic regions of the Loess Plateau and LP.</li><li><code>Pattern</code> : The spatial pattern of this period.</li><li><code>Relationship</code> : The relationship between ECC and Precipitation.</li></ul></li><li><strong>W (GPP/ECC)</strong><ul><li>Brief introduction of W.</li><li><code>Sequence</code> : Time sequence of rainfall between start year and end year, including six geomorphic regions of the Loess Plateau and LP.</li><li><code>Pattern</code> : The spatial pattern of this period.</li><li><code>Percentage</code> : The percentage of w for different in LP countys. </li></ul></li><li><strong>GPP-ECC</strong><ul><li>Brief introduction of GPP subtract ECC.</li><li><code>Sequence</code> : Time sequence of rainfall between start year and end year, including six geomorphic regions of the Loess Plateau and LP.</li><li><code>Pattern</code> : The spatial pattern of this period.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Region Statistic</strong><ul><li>Different region statistc results, include LP/County/Geomorphic Zone/Ecological Zone/Brain.</li><li>The percentage of different status(overload w &gt;
